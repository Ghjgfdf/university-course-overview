# What I Learned from "Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Distributed Systems"

In this course, I gained a deep understanding of how operating systems, networks, and distributed systems work together. Here's a detailed breakdown of key concepts.

## 1. **Operating Systems**
Operating systems manage hardware and software resources, providing an interface for users to interact with the computer. The course covered how OS handles memory management, process scheduling, and user permissions.

- **Virtual Memory Management**: Modern operating systems use virtual memory to ensure efficient use of RAM, allowing multiple programs to run simultaneously without conflict.
- **Kernel Mode vs User Mode**: The kernel operates in a privileged mode, managing system resources securely. Mismanagement at the user level cannot compromise system stability.

## 2. **File Systems and Storage**
A large part of the course covered file systems and how operating systems manage data storage on physical and virtual devices. Topics included inode-based file systems and memory management techniques like paging.

- **File Systems (Inode-based)**: Modern storage systems use inode structures to efficiently store and retrieve data across hard drives and SSDs, allowing for seamless file access even in massive databases.
- **Paging**: By splitting memory into pages, systems can handle more tasks simultaneously without consuming too much physical memory.

## 3. **Computer Networks**
Computer networks are essential for sharing resources between computers. The course delved into network topologies, protocols like TCP/IP, and the OSI model that structures network communication into layers.

- **TCP/IP Protocol Stack**: TCP/IP governs the internet, enabling communication between billions of devices. Network engineers rely on understanding these protocols to configure and secure networks.
- **Network Topologies**: Different topologies (e.g., star, mesh) are used based on the networkâ€™s purpose, whether in local office setups or large-scale data centers.

## 4. **Mobile Computing**
The course explored mobile computing technologies, including mobile operating systems and communication networks like 4G and 5G.

- **Mobile OS**: Operating systems like Android and iOS manage limited mobile resources to ensure efficiency and smooth user experience. 
- **Mobile Internet Protocols**: Protocols ensure that mobile devices can access the internet securely and efficiently, enabling services like GPS and streaming.

## 5. **Distributed Systems**
Distributed systems allow multiple computers to work on a common task by dividing resources and responsibilities across the network. This section explained concepts such as client-server architecture, cloud computing, and communication between nodes.

- **Client-Server Model**: Centralized servers provide services to multiple clients. This architecture is the backbone of modern internet applications, from web browsing to email.
- **Cloud Computing**: Cloud services like AWS and Azure are distributed systems that allow scalable resource allocation. Understanding distributed systems helps in building efficient cloud applications.

## 6. **Security in Distributed Systems**
The course emphasized the importance of security in networks and mobile systems, particularly in distributed environments. Key Security Practices:

- **Data Encryption**: Ensures that sensitive information is transmitted securely across networks, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Access Control**: Ensuring that only authorized users can access certain system resources, an essential feature in multi-user systems.

## Conclusion
This course gave me a comprehensive understanding of how operating systems, networks, and distributed systems are designed and function. These concepts are crucial for solving real-world problems in areas like cloud computing, cybersecurity, and mobile technology.
